 - This part of the assignment simulates a simple quiz game where clients connect and send information to a server over protobuff.
 - The server can be run using gradle runServer.
 - The client can be run using gradle runClient.
 - The program should expect mainly string inputs since the answers to questions are single words. However, since everything is initially handled as a string, unhandled inputs should not occur.
